Congratulations! You almost finished the whole project already in the Iteration 2. You won 23 out of 24 in the cross-group evaluation system. In your personal reviews, you two can see the contributions from each other. Trent found a nice UML tool, Argo. I hope Trey can also use the similar tool in your personal assignment. Also your group can actively involve in the project discussions.
However, you should pay attention to the following things:
1.	Login and login alternate flow should be in the same “system sequence diagrams” using OPT frame box, and the same as the “register” use case (-5)
2.	Please update use case model as well as the descriptions of each use case. (5)
3.	Add all action items in the Iteration Plan to the GitHub repository's issue tracker. (5)
4.	Some “readme” files for the codes. (5pts)
5.	Design diagram should be matched to the codes. For example, “log in” in SSD has the corresponding file in the code “login”, although there is another file called “logout”. But I didn’t find the “register” file. (5 pt)

Some comments from other groups
